# session configuration, make last eighteen hours. sessions are stored entirely
# in a cookie so don't store anything large in them. we typically use them only
# to store the user's netid for ajax login purposes. also, don't store secret
# information in the session:

#
# note: the SESSION_COOKIE_PATH should only be set to "/" when you're going to
# use the defaults for a domain, e.g. barista.cac, because it causes all of the
# flask applications on that domain to use the same session cookie.
#
# note: the permanent session lifetime is only used if the session is marked as
# "permanent" when it is created in your app.py script. it is recommended that
# you make your session "permanent". otherwise the session is cleared when the
# user closes the browser or whenever the browser decides to clear the session.
